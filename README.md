# How to use my project

First by clicking run , the console will ask what query you want either Create , Read , Update or Delete
.

This not case sensitive but does need to be typed properly or the system will not understand your input.

When correct input has been inputed you might be asked for some input about what specific query you want to carry out except the read whole table section which just gives you the whole table.

## Testing

With over 60% COVERAGE TESTED I've completed testing my person class as well as part of the Crud testing just need to test Exception:

```bash
Error: Bad Query
```
